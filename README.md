  ## Installation

  * Download the repository files
  * In the primary directory set up a .env file like the following, with *1 being your postgres username and *2 being the password
  
  ```
  DB_USER=*1  
  DB_PASSWORD=*2  
  DB_LINK=employees_db
  ```

  * Ensure you have postgres and node set up in your dev environment.

  ## Usage

  1.) Open your terminal in the main directory of the project  
  2.) Run ```psql -U postgres``` and login  
  3.) Run ```\i ./db/schema.sql``` to set up the database and tables  
  4.) Run ```\i ./db/seeds.sql``` to fill in some information from the seeding file  
  5.) Now quit postgres with ```\q```  
  6.) You can then run ```npm i``` to make sure all dependencies are installed  
  7.) Then ```npm run build``` to build the typescript into .js files in a /dist directory  
  8.) Last ```npm run start``` should start the index.js file and run the init(); function starting the command line interface

  * `src/connection.ts` taken and edited from `NU-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2024-U-LOLC\10-SQL\01-Activities\24-Stu_Parameterized-Queries\Solved\src\connection.ts` in curriculum.
  * `src/index.ts` addEmployeeInput() and updateEmployeeRoleSelect() functions generated using copilot with addDepartmentInput() and addRoleInput() functions as reference. Tweaks made to all, some additional notes in comments.
  * `tsconfig.json` generated by copilot, edits in comments.
  * `queries.ts` line 37 credit to examples and tests from [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/postgresql/postgresql_exercises.php) for letting me figure out missing employees with no managers in the table when using viewEmployees() (fixed by LEFT JOIN since their manager id is NULL query didn't work as intended otherwise)

  ## Tests

  To test the program simply use the different functions in the commmand line interface and double check the database has been altered appropriately, either with custom queries or using the view functions provided.
